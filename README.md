TODO
==
* Paypal IPN (instant payment notifications) notify the IRC channel when an invoice is made and paid.
* Gitlab commit notifications to IRC.
* Jira issues management to IRC. Similar to what Bukkit does.
* Trello integration or something similar? Ability to see potential, active, and completed projects would be nice and notify IRC when changes are made.
* Google calendar hook to give us reminders on due dates of projects, contracts expiring, and anything else.
* Per channel command disabling.
* Global ignored users.
* Don't allow voiced users to kick ops.
