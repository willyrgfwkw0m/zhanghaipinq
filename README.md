Style Guidelines
======

- There should be one space before each opening brace (Eg: if (true) {)
- There should be one space before each opening bracket in a control statement (See above example)
    - An exception would be "public void myMethod() {"
- Uses 4 spaces, not tabs
- Blank control blocks should be on a new line
- There should be no one-line statements (Eg: if (true) callMethod();)
